**This library is heavily under development. Do not use it in production.**

**LiteAgent** is a~~nother~~ lightweight Python library that empowers you to build and orchestrate intelligent agents
and tools
for your applications. By leveraging large language models (or LLMs, for short) from providers such as OpenAI, Ollama,
LlamaCCP, and others, LiteAgent allows your agents to work seamlessly with custom tools to perform complex tasks.

## Installation

*... currently not working*

LiteAgent can be installed via your preferred package manager. For example, if you are using UV, you can add LiteAgent
with:

```bash
uv add liteagent
```

Alternatively, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install liteagent
```

## How does it work?

As any agent library, here's your first ~~not very useful~~ agent:

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic import BaseModel

from liteagent import agent, tool
from liteagent.providers import ollama


class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    occupation: str
    favorite_color: str
    favorite_weather: str
    favorite_food: str


@tool
def personal_info() -> Person: return Person(
    name="Gabriel",
    age=32,
    occupation="Software Engineer",
    favorite_color="Blue",
    favorite_weather="Cold",
    favorite_food="Pizza"
)


@agent(provider=ollama(model='llama3.2'), tools=[personal_info])
async def hello_agent() -> str: ...


asyncio.run(hello_agent("who am I?"))
```

When you use the `@agent` and `@tool` decorators, LiteAgent converts your async functions into intelligent agents and
tools. The decorators perform several important tasks: they capture the functionâ€™s signature and its associated
docstring, which acts as a dynamic prompt template. This design enables the agent to format incoming parameters directly
into the prompt, making interactions more natural and contextually relevant.

The library is built with asynchronicity in mind. All agents and tools are asynchronous by default, which ensures
efficient handling of I/O-bound operations and network requests. However, LiteAgent is also designed to work in
synchronous environments. It carefully offloads synchronous processing to a dedicated CPU thread when needed, giving you
the flexibility to choose the most appropriate execution model for your use case.

Another significant strength of LiteAgent lies in its flexible and extensible provider strategy. The library is built to
integrate with multiple LLM providers and makes it straightforward to add new ones. This extensibility means that you
can easily swap out or combine providers like OpenAI, Ollama, and LlamaCCP, tailoring the behavior of your agents to the
requirements of your application.
