Example 07: Smart Assistant - Long-term Memory

This example demonstrates:
- Using memoria for long-term memory
- Persistent information storage
- Information retrieval across sessions
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) concepts

Concepts introduced:
- memoria tool (long-term memory)
- Persistent storage
- Memory retrieval
- RAG basics

Run: uv run python examples/07_smart_assistant.py

    You are a personal assistant with long-term memory.

    IMPORTANT:
    - ALWAYS check your memory before responding to questions
    - Store important facts and preferences the user shares
    - Recall information from previous conversations
    - Use memoria tool to store and retrieve information

    When user shares information (preferences, facts, plans):
    - Store it in memoria for later retrieval

    When user asks questions:
    - Search memoria first for relevant information
    - Provide personalized responses based on stored data
